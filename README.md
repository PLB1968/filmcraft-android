<p align="center">
  <b>Rushcraft is a mobile video editor for Android in the spirit of Adobe's discontinued Premiere Rush: a desktop-style editor (Source and Program monitors, tracks, Premiere's tools) on your phone. It is a fork of <a href="https://github.com/artcraft-android/filmcraft-android">FilmCraft for Android</a>, built on the same Rust engine, <a href="https://github.com/storytold/filmcraft">FilmCraft</a>, with a Kotlin/Jetpack Compose UI.</b><br>

## Building Instructions
*One Gradle command builds the whole app: it compiles the Rust engine with [cargo-ndk](https://github.com/bbqsrc/cargo-ndk) and generates the Kotlin bindings.*

* Clone this repository
* Make sure you have at least 4 GB of free disk space
* enter `apps/rushcraft-android/android` and run `./gradlew assembleRelease`, or open that folder in Android Studio and press Run.

Build time dependencies:

<details>
  <summary>required tools</summary>

  ```
      rustup (it installs the Rust release and Android targets rust-toolchain.toml names)
      cargo install cargo-ndk --version 4.1.2 --locked
      Android SDK (API 37) and NDK 29.0.14206865
      JDK 17 or newer
  ```
</details>

*Builds are only tested on Windows 11.*
